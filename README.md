# VS Code extension with a tree view and a viewer for the elements

This is a very simple extension that illustrates how to build a custom
viewer that can be opened by selecting items in a view on the Explorer.

## Try it out

To build run

```
yarn
yarn build
```
To launch it, open up in VS Code and run the Extension
launch.

## Description

The highlight of the architecture is a typical web client/server.
The server is the VS Code extension which starts an http server
and uses Express to manage routes. The client is a typical client
which runs in a webview created with the vscode previewHtml command.
The final piece is a tree data provider which populates a view and
adds commands to add and remove items and to open them up in the viewer.

The build is split into two parts, a simple call to the TypeScript
compiler for the extension/server, and a call to webpack to process
the client. The client is a React Typescript app compiled with the
webpack ts-loader.

The key workflow starts with the open method on the HelloItemTree.
It calls the vscode previewHtml code passing a Uri, ViewColumn option,
and a label. This opens up an editor that has an embedded webview
element with the label passed in as the name in the editor tab.

The magic part is the Uri. The scheme of the Uri selects a text
document content provider. The provider implements provide text 
document content method to return the HTML to show in the webview.

Once loaded the HTML can access file URLs to load more content.
In this case, we load the JavaScript file generated by webpack.
We also embed in the original HTML additional data that the server
wants to pass to the client. We pass the item selected in the tree
as well as the URL to the embedded API server.
